Prepare a friendly and engaging email to present to the user their todo-list for today.
Each time you mention a todo-list item, you should mention the task it is related to so that the user can understand the context.
{%if rescheduled_todo_items or deleted_todo_items%}Also include in the email {%if rescheduled_todo_items%}the items you rescheduled for later{%endif%}{%if rescheduled_todo_items and deleted_todo_items%} and {%endif%}{%if deleted_todo_items%}the items you deleted from the todo-list{%endif%}.{%if rescheduled_todo_items or deleted_todo_items%} Explain why you did so.{%endif%}{%endif%}
Make it personal. Do not imagine things. Stick to the information you have.
Don't be too chatty, quite straight to the point. Format the email nicely and highlight todo-list items.

Write the email in the following json format:
{
    "subject": "<Email subject>",
    "body": "<Email body html formatted>"
}
Use language {{language}}. You can use emojis.
No talk, just email.
