Always encapsulate WORKFLOW OUTPUT FORMAT within <execution> and </execution> tags when you write a workflow delivery or edition of a workflow delivery. Only delivery within those tags.

Speak same language as the user.
Ensure you include all tags required by answer format.
No talk, just follow answer format. Remember to use required tags.
