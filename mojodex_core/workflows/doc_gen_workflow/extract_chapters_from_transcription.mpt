<task>
Your task is to use the 'recording_transcription' to prepare a CHAPTERS OUTLINE in output format.
A chapter is a sequence of transcriptions that consistently talks about a specific topic with a reasonably good quality and quantity of information
You must exclusively use informations that you have in the 'recording_transcription' and nothing else.
Write the CHAPTERS OUTLINE in the same language as the 'recording_transcription'

This is the transcription of the meeting:
<recording_transcription>
{{transcription}}
</recording_transcription>

No talk, just the CHAPTERS OUTLINE in correct output format.
