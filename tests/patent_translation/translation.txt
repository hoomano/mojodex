Device for dispensing a formulation of at least two compounds chosen from a set of selectable compounds containing associated

Technical Field

The invention relates to a device for dispensing a formulation of at least two compounds chosen from a set of selectable compounds.

The various containers incorporating these selectable compounds may be in the form of interchangeable containers allowing for the replenishment of the selectable compounds of the dispensing device. Thus, the invention also relates to a container associated with the dispensing device.

The invention can be implemented in a large number of fields for which it is sought to obtain a formulation from different possible compounds.

The invention finds a particularly advantageous application in the field of cosmetics in which it is sought to be able to formulate a cream customizing to the skin treatment needs of a user.

State of the Art

Cosmetic products have evolved in recent years to specifically meet the treatment needs of a user's skin. To do this, several solutions now propose to test the physiological characteristics of a user's skin to guide them towards the purchase of a suitable cream. Instead of advising the purchase of a standard cream, the company IOMA® offers a solution called "IOMA In.Lab" allowing to test the physiological parameters of a user in a store to formulate a custom cream.

However, the physiological parameters of a user's skin can vary over time, and it is sought to be able to formulate tailor-made treatments that evolve over time according to the stresses experienced by the user's skin. To do this, the company IEVA® proposes a jewelry "Twin.C" intended to be worn by the user to measure, over time, the parameters of the environment in which the user evolves. This jewelry "Twin.C" allows measuring external or internal pollution, sun exposure, ambient noise, brightness, temperature and humidity, and the number of steps. With all this information, it is possible to advise a health/well-being ritual adapted to each user and capable of evolving over time. In addition, it is possible to determine the formulation of a cream specifically adapted to a user's needs.

The realization of this cream can then be formulated in-store, for example with the "IOMA In.Lab" solution. To be more independent and reactive, this cream can also be made at home. To do this, several companies offer machines for formulating a custom cosmetic product, for example, the "HyLab" formulator from the company Romy° or the "Custom D.O.S.E" solution from the company L'Oréal° whose machine is described in patent WO 2017/95854.

To generate his custom cream, the user has a certain number of capsules containing the compounds of the different creams that he can formulate from the machine. During the manufacture of the cream, the machine proceeds to extract the desired quantities of the compounds present in the different capsules inserted into the machine. The machine then mixes the extracted compounds to obtain a cream whose appearance corresponds to a standard cream but whose compounds and their quantities are determined to measure.

This type of solution is nevertheless very little transportable because, like a coffee machine, this machine requires an electrical supply and a large number of electromechanical actuators to obtain the desired formulation, and in particular to proceed with the mixing of the compounds.

In addition, the use of capsules to integrate the different compounds that can be used to obtain the formulation leads to storage constraints and pollution generated by the waste of used capsules.

Technical Problem

The technical problem of the invention is to obtain a formulation of at least two compounds chosen from a set of selectable compounds in a much more transportable way than existing solutions.

Description of the Invention

To solve this technical problem, the invention proposes a dispensing device allowing the extraction of compounds stored in containers to be conveyed to a dispensing surface. Thus, instead of completely making a cream with the necessary mixing step, the invention proposes to deliver a desired quantity of the formulation for each application. By delivering the compounds on the dispensing surface, the user can then collect the compounds with his finger to apply the formulation to his skin. The user's finger collecting the components thus performs the association of the compounds. The invention is therefore the result of a discovery that the active principles of a cream do not result from the mixing step classically performed but from the compounds taken independently. Thus, a simple association of the compounds, carried out with a user's finger, is sufficient to obtain the same effects on the skin. To this end, according to a first aspect, the invention relates to a dispensing device of a formulation of at least two compounds chosen from a set of selectable compounds, said device comprising:
- a plurality of containers storing said different selectable compounds;
- pumping means associated with each container;
- a dispensing surface comprising at least two outlet orifices intended to convey at least two chosen compounds;
- selection means allowing to dispose said at least two outlet orifices in front of the pumping means of said chosen compounds so as to allow said pumping means of said chosen compounds to convey said chosen compounds on the dispensing surface; and
- an actuator configured to activate only the pumping means of said chosen compounds and to deliver only said at least two chosen compounds on said dispensing surface.

The invention thus allows delivering, on a dispensing surface, a specific formulation obtained from a set of selectable compounds. In doing so, the invention allows a user to make a dose of a cream adapted to his needs.

Unlike existing custom formulation machines that aim to make a complete pot of cream, the invention proposes to distribute only one or more doses necessary for an application, so that the invention's dispensing device can be much more compact and transportable than existing formulation machines.

According to the invention, the pumping means may correspond to pumps actuated mechanically or electromechanically. In the case of electromechanical pumps, the dispensing device preferably integrates batteries and a control card for the electromechanical actuators integrated into the dispensing device to form an autonomous and compact dispensing device.

Preferably, the dispensing device comprises mechanical pumps to form the pumping means to obtain a purely mechanical dispensing device. In this embodiment, said actuator preferably corresponds to a push button whose upper face corresponds to said dispensing surface, said pumping means having a stroke greater than or equal to the stroke of the push button. Thus, the activation of the push button activates the pumps and allows the selected compounds to be delivered to the dispensing surface.

The selection of the compounds can be carried out by any mechanical or electromechanical means. Preferably, the selection means correspond to mechanical means that allow moving the orifices or the containers to modify the correspondence between the orifices and the containers.

According to a first embodiment in which the orifices are fixed, at least one of said selection means corresponds to a barrel integrating several containers, a rotation of said barrel causing a modification of the correspondence between an orifice and one of the containers integrated into said barrel.

This embodiment allows mechanically selecting the chosen compounds to distribute the formulation. When the compounds are selected, the user can then simply activate the pumping means via the actuator to obtain the compounds of the formulation on the dispensing surface. It is possible to inhibit the operation of the actuator to avoid possible false manipulations of the dispensing device. To do this, it is possible to use a protective cap which, once in place, blocks access to the actuator. According to this embodiment, said device comprises a removable protective cap configured to cover said dispensing surface and inhibit the activation of said actuator. Regarding the compounds used by the dispensing device, they can vary depending on the applications of the dispensing device. Preferably, said device comprises two distinct types of compounds stored in two distinct types of containers; said at least two compounds being chosen to obtain a formulation of at least one first type of compounds and at least one second type of compounds.

For example, said device comprises between one and three compounds of the first type and between six and eight compounds of the second type to allow obtaining a large number of possible formulations. Depending on the applications, compounds of different natures can be used. For example, the invention can be implemented for the formulation of a cosmetic cream. In this embodiment, said first type of compounds may correspond to bases, for example aqueous or oily bases, and said second type of compounds may correspond to serums.

For a cosmetic cream, a formulation typically comprises a base and a serum with a larger quantity of base than serum. To obtain this volume difference with the dispensing device, the first containers have a larger volume than the second containers and said pumping means associated with said first containers have a larger pumping volume than said pumping means associated with said second containers for the same activation of said actuator. Preferably, said plurality of containers is integrated into at least one support having at least two removable parts to allow the replacement or filling of at least one container. By replacing the containers according to his needs, a user can increase the number of possible formulations that he can make with said dispensing device of the invention by using containers with other compounds than those present in the dispensing device.

In addition, replacing the containers also increases the lifespan of the dispensing device by replacing or filling the empty containers. The possibility of being able to fill the emptied containers also limits the waste generated by the dispensing device of the invention, thus improving its ecological footprint.

Detailed Description of the Invention

In the following description, two distinct embodiments illustrate an entirely mechanical dispensing device. Alternatively, the invention can be implemented with electromechanical components.

Figures 1 to 3 illustrate a dispensing device 10a according to a first embodiment of the invention which is not included in the object of the claims.

In this embodiment, the dispensing device 10a has a substantially cylindrical shape with a height between 7 and 15 cm and a diameter between 3 and 10 cm.

Thus, the dispensing device 10a is in the form of a transportable bottle.

This dispensing device 10a has an outer shell formed by several superimposed parts 11a-11e and fixed together. The three lower parts 11a to 11c have complementary truncated cylindrical shapes allowing to obtain a cylinder integrating the different selectable compounds. The assembly of these three lower parts 11a to 11c allows varying the materials, textures, or colors of this cylinder. Above this cylinder, the shell has a shoulder 11d surmounted by a cylindrical rim 11e. In addition, these different parts 11a-11e of the shell are mounted in a removable manner so as to open the shell and replace or fill one of the containers 14a, 15. The shoulder 11d and the rim 11e allow integrating the pumping means 16-17 and the selection means 18-19.

In addition, the rim 11e is configured to support a protective cap 12 allowing to close the dispensing device 10a. For example, the protective cap 12 can be mounted by clipping or screwing onto the rim 11e.

Inside the dispensing device 10a, the different selectable compounds are integrated into containers 14a-15. The selectable compounds can be distributed in containers of large volume 14a integrating base compounds and containers of small volume 15 integrating serums to formulate a cosmetic cream. For example, the containers 14a have a volume between 20 and 35 ml while the containers 15 have a volume between 3 and 8 ml.

Of course, other types of compounds can be used to obtain other formulations without changing the invention.

The extraction of the compounds stored in these containers 14a-15 is preferably carried out by a manual pump 16 or 17 associated with each container 14a-15.

A manual pump can aspirate the compounds through a supply tube extending to the bottom of the container. Preferably, a piston is integrated into each container 14a15 so that a pressure exerted on its pump 16-17 causes a depression that tends to move the piston towards the top of the container to extract the compound through an opening provided at the top of the pump 16-17.

To obtain the desired formulation, the dispensing device 10a allows conveying the chosen compounds to a dispensing surface 20a so that a user can collect it with his finger. To form the selection means, the embodiment of Figures 1 to 8 proposes to use two concentric rings 18-19 forming at the same time the dispensing surface 20a, the selection means of the chosen compounds, and an actuator for the pumps 16-17. The ring 19 being mounted on the ring 18, the ring 18 is called "lower ring" while the ring 19 is called "upper ring" in the rest of the description.

As illustrated in Figures 4 and 5, the lower ring 18 has a central cylinder 35 whose lower face is provided with a guide pin 36. For example, the central cylinder 35 may have a thickness between 0.8 and 5mm and a diameter between 2 and 8 cm. The lower face of the lower ring 18 extends in the form of a disc 37 whose diameter is greater than that of the central cylinder 35. For example, the disc 37 may have a thickness between 0.4 and 2mm and a diameter between 3 and 10 cm. The terminal part of this disc 37 has a rim 38 extending orthoradially towards the upper face 40 of the central cylinder 35. The height of this rim 38 can be between 0.2 and 2 mm.

The central cylinder 35 has a cylindrical orifice 21 opening onto both the upper 40 and lower faces and made close to the edges of the central cylinder 35. This cylindrical orifice 21 may have a diameter between 0.4 and 2 mm. In addition, six other orifices 22a are regularly distributed in the disc 37. These other cylindrical orifices 22a may also have a diameter between 0.4 and 2 mm.

As illustrated in Figure 6, the upper ring 19 is in the form of a ring 19. This ring 19 may have an internal diameter between 2 and 8 cm and an external diameter between 3 and 10 cm. The thickness of this ring 19 is preferably between 0.4 and 2 mm. A cylindrical through orifice 22b is provided in the thickness of this ring 19. This orifice 22b may have a diameter between 0.4 and 2 mm.

As illustrated in Figure 7, the dispensing surface 20a is obtained by the two upper surfaces 40-41 of the two rings 18-19. These two upper surfaces 40-41 are substantially coplanar when the upper ring 19 is mounted around the lower ring 18. Thus, the center of the dispensing surface 20a is formed by the upper face 40 of the lower ring 18 passing through the upper ring 19 while the periphery of this dispensing surface 20a is formed by the upper face 41 of the lower ring 18.

To select the compounds and convey them to the dispensing surface 20a, the two rings 18-19 are movable in rotation around a central axis Al. Preferably, these rings 18-19 can only be rotated when the protective cap 12 is removed from the dispensing device 10a.

The lower ring 18 is mounted directly above the set of pumps 16-17 and its through orifice 21 allows conveying a compound present in a container 14a to its upper face 40, that is to say, on the dispensing surface 20a. The conveyance of a compound present in a container 15 is carried out by passing through the orifices 22a of the lower ring 18 and the orifice 22b of the upper ring 19.

The activation of the pumps 16-17 is obtained by moving the two rings 18-19. To do this, the two rings 18-19 are placed on the set of pumps 16-17 and the pin 36 ensures the guidance of the movement of the two rings 18-19.

In addition, the upper ring 19 is bent over the lower ring 18 at the level of the rim 38 so that the two rings 18-19 are movable together along the axis Al. The movement of the two rings 18-19 is consecutive to a user's pressure on the dispensing surface 20a. This pressure has the effect of compressing all the pumps 16-17 and causing the distribution of the formulation of the selected compounds. Indeed, during the activation of the pumps 16-17, only the pumps arranged in front of the orifices 21 and 22b see their compounds conveyed to the dispensing surface 20a. After activation, that is to say, after the user's pressure, the two rings 18-19 are repositioned to their initial positions by the decompression of the springs of the pumps 16-17.

To facilitate the selection of the different compounds and prevent one of the orifices 21 and 22b from being positioned between two pumps 16-17, position detents are preferably implemented. For example, Figure 7 illustrates a pin 50 and a spring integrated into a bore of the lower ring 18 and configured to cooperate with bores present at each possible position of the upper ring 19. Thus, the user can feel a difference in the rotation effort of the upper ring 19 between the possible positions and the intermediate positions of the ring 19.

This embodiment, illustrated in Figures 1 to 7, which is not included in the object of the claims, can be implemented regardless of the shape of the containers. For example, the invention can be implemented with standard cylindrical containers. Prefer ably, to optimize the space inside the shell 11a-11e, the large volume container 14a has a specific shape allowing both to contain a compound and to integrate housings 30 to position cylindrical containers 15 of smaller volume. As illustrated in Figure 8, the container 14a has a hollow body 25 having substantially the shape of a portion of a cylinder with two flat faces and a hemispherical face 29 extending in the height of the portion of the cylinder. The lower face of the body 25 has a substantially flat surface while the upper face 26 of the body 25 integrates a pump 16 allowing to extract the compound stored in the body 25. In addition, the hemispherical face 29 has two housings 30 opening onto the upper face 26 extending substantially between half the height of the body 25 and the upper surface 26. In addition to using the rings 18-19 to select the compounds of the formulation, it is also possible to use one or more barrels 33-34 instead of one of the rings 18-19. In addition, it is possible to select more than two compounds by increasing the number of selection means. For example, by using three rings, it is possible to select three distinct compounds to distribute a formulation. The selection means can also have an intermediate position between several containers in which no compound is delivered so that it is possible to deliver only one compound by positioning one of the selection means in this intermediate position.

Figures 9 to 16 illustrate a second embodiment using two barrels 33-34 to select the compounds. In the same way as in the first embodiment, a dispensing surface 20b is arranged opposite a set of pumps 16-17 mounted on containers 14b-15. However, this dispensing surface 20b is fixed, and it is the containers 14b-15 that are movable relative to this dispensing surface 20b.

To do this, the dispensing device 20b has a first barrel 33 comprising a lower cylinder 52 and an upper cylinder 53 of smaller diameter forming a shoulder 32. Three cylindrical containers 14b are inserted into the two cylinders and protrude in height.

The shoulder 32 allows mounting a second barrel 34 taking the form of a hollow cylinder supporting twelve containers 15.

A distribution cap 51 is fixedly mounted above the two barrels 33-34. This distribution cap 51 has an axis 57 mounted on a central axis 58 of the first barrel 33 so that the axis 58 of the first barrel 33 is rotatable relative to the axis 57 of the distribution cap 51.

The second barrel 34 is constrained in translation between the shoulder 32 and the distribution cap 51 so that this second barrel 34 is rotatable around the axes 57-58, independently of the rotations of the first barrel 33. As illustrated in Figure 14, the upper end of the second barrel 33 may have lugs 54 so as to form position detents relative to the dispensing surface 20b.

The first barrel 33 is removably mounted on the axis 57 so that the two barrels can be disassembled to replace or fill one of the containers 14b, 15. In addition, the level of the containers 15 can be directly visible through the openings 31.

In the distribution cap 51, two orifices 55 and 56 are provided so as to allow the pumps 16-17 arranged in front of these orifices 55-56 to convey their contents to the dispensing surface 20b. In addition, since the orifices 55 and 56 are fixed, the dispensing surface 20b can be structured to facilitate the user's grasping of the compounds, as illustrated in Figure 16. In the same way as for the first embodiment, the actuation of the pumps 16-17 can be carried out by moving the dispensing surface 20b.

The invention thus allows obtaining a dispensing device of a formulation of at least two compounds chosen from a set of selectable compounds much more transportable than existing solutions. In addition, this dispensing device can be entirely mechanical.

Thus, a user can quickly and simply formulate a custom formulation according to his needs. For example, with the invention, a user can formulate one or more doses of a cosmetic cream adapted to treat his skin.
