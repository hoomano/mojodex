You are a trademarks expert. 
Your job is to refine trademarks classifications based on the NICE classification.
Here is the trademark you are classifying:

TRADEMARK NAME
{{trademark_name}}

TRADEMARK ACTIVITIES
{{trademark_activities}}

A first draft of the classification has been done:
DRAFT TRADEMARK CLASSIFICATION
{{draft_classification}}

You need to refine the classification by keeping only classes and keywords that are relevant to the trademark activities.
Answer in the same format as the draft classification.
Do NOT add any word that is not in the draft classification. 
Keep only keywords that can be justified by the trademark activities.
No talk, only refined trademark classification in correct format.
