# Mojodex Scheduler

The scheduler is responsible for running tasks at specific times or intervals.
It is useful for running tasks that are not directly related to a user's request, like sending emails or notifs to a group of users.
It is also useful for proactivity, to let Mojo work on something by checking state of a user or a task at a certain frequency and act accordingly.
