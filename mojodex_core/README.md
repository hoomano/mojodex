# Mojodex Entities

This directory contains the entities that are used in the Mojodex application. An entity is a class that represents a table in the database. The entity class is used to interact with the database table.

It uses `sqlacodegen` to generate the entity classes from the database schema. The `sqlacodegen` tool is a Python library that can be used to generate SQLAlchemy model code from an existing database.
