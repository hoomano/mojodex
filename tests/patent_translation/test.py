(57) Abstract: ADJUSTABLE CONNECTION which is used to allow its connection with pipes (T) with different diameters, preferably, but not exclusively, pipes (T) with a minimum diameter of 150 mm. and with a maximum diameter of 200mm, said pipes (T) can be a water or sewage connection pipe; the adjustable connection (1) also has a monoblock body (2) obtained by plastic injection process, a sealing ring (3) and a self-locking strap (4); the monoblock body (2) consists of a semicircular portion (5), which has a housing (6) for fitting the sealing ring (3), as well as lateral projections (7) and (8) for anchoring and locking the self-locking strap (4), specifically regarding the lateral projection (8), where the strap (4) is locked, a lock (9) is provided for mounting, through which the strap (4) is passed in only one direction; the strap (4) in turn has a serration (10) on its outer face (11), while on its inner face (12) two raised ribs (13) are provided, said strap (4) also has a limiting end (30).

"ADJUSTABLE CONNECTION"

FIELD OF APPLICATION

[1] The object dealt with in this utility model patent application concerns an adjustable connection with self-locking closing action, which is equipped with a sealing ring.

[2] The adjustable connection proposed here has a variable section, a fact that allows its installation and adjustment, quickly and safely, in pipelines with various diameter measurements within a given range of measurements between a minimum diameter and a maximum diameter to enable water and sewage connections.
PREAMBLE

[3] This descriptive report deals with a utility model patent application that addresses an adjustable connection with self-locking closing action, which has a variable section sealing ring for connections, which is intended, in conjunction, to be mounted on a pipeline that can be either for water supply or sewage collection.

[4] The adjustable connection discussed here allows the installation of the same by adjusting its regulation according to the diameter of the pipeline in which the connection will be used, reducing manufacturing and operational costs.
STATE OF THE ART

[5] The current state of the art includes connections with various dimensions and sealing rings of different sections to be used according to the specific diameter measurements of the pipe in which they will be mounted.

[6] For this reason, several connection entities_controllers need to be manufactured and stored to meet the entire range of pipe diameter measurements (water or sewage) used in a network by a sanitation company.

[7] In the current state of the art, there are some connection entities_controllers of the type addressed by this utility model patent application, such as those illustrated in figures 1 and 2.

[8] Figure 1 depicts a first example of a connection from the state of the art, which is called a "saddle with lock", which is defined by a structure formed by two basic plastic rigid parts, one upper and one lower, both with a half-cane shape.

[9] The upper portion has, in its upper region, a perpendicular tubular branch intended to serve as a location for coupling a pipeline.

[0010] Against the upper portion, a complementary half-cane-shaped portion is mounted, which has, on one of its edges, a hinge flap that connects it to the corresponding edge of the upper portion.

[0011] The upper and lower portions of the "saddle with lock" connection, after being accommodated to the pipeline in which the connection is to be mounted, receive a locking profile that is fitted to the corresponding edges of both the upper and lower portions.

[0012] Figure 2 depicts another example of a connection belonging to the state of the art, which is called an "adjustable saddle", which has a basic shape similar to the "saddle with lock" model depicted in figure 1.

[0013] The "adjustable saddle" connection also has an upper half-cane portion and a lower half-cane portion, with the upper half-cane portion having a perpendicular tubular branch intended to serve as a location for coupling a pipeline.

[0014] The "adjustable saddle" connection differs from the "saddle with lock" model in that it has a hinge-like structure that connects, on one side, the upper and lower portions, while the opposite side of the mentioned portions has a closing means based on screws and nuts that connect the extreme flap of the upper portion to a flap incorporated in a postiche sector mounted on the lower portion, said postiche sector having locking teeth that can be selectively coupled to windows for such teeth provided in the wall of the mentioned lower portion.
PROBLEMS OF THE STATE OF THE ART

[0015] The connections belonging to the state of the art, due to not allowing their assembly in pipelines with variations in diameter measurement, require the manufacture of several entities_controllers with specific measurements and that meet only one unique diameter measurement of the pipeline, a fact that increases the maintenance costs of a network, whether for water supply or sewage collection.

[0016] With respect to the two examples belonging to the state of the art, that is, the "saddle with lock" connection depicted in figure 1 and the "adjustable saddle" connection depicted in figure 2, the same problem of limitation regarding the pipe diameter measurement in which such connections can be mounted is verified.

[0017] The two connection entities_controllers depicted in figures 1 and 2 do not have the characteristic of being able to serve a varied range of diameter measurements concerning the pipelines in which they will be mounted, a fact that requires sanitation companies to have a large number of entities_controllers of both types in stock for use in specific pipeline measurements, whether for water supply or sewage collection.

[0018] Thus, it is clear that the connections belonging to the state of the art, due to their design and construction limitations, do not allow a single connection model to be mounted on a varied range of pipeline diameter measurements, thus increasing the operational costs of sanitation companies.

[0019] The fact that current connections do not allow the necessary adjustment to the various market pipes requires the acquisition of different sealing entities_controllers to maintain the watertightness of the assembly.

[0020] A specific drawback of the "adjustable saddle" connection model is related to the fact that it employs, as already mentioned, metallic nuts, washers, and screws, components that obviously need to have a minimum anti-corrosion treatment and for this reason are high-cost components that ultimately increase, globally, the manufacturing cost and consequently the acquisition cost of each connection unit by sanitation companies.
OBJECTIVES OF THE INNOVATION

[0021] In view of the state of the art described above, the object of this utility model patent application has been developed, which proposes an adjustable connection equipped with a sealing ring, which incorporates, for its installation and adjustment, a strap with self-locking closing action, thus facilitating the water and sewage connection process.

[0022] In addition, the object discussed here has a variable section sealing ring allowing proper seating and perfect sealing to the pipe in which the adjustable connection itself will be installed.
[0023] It is also the purpose of the object dealt with in this utility model patent application to reduce manufacturing and operational costs, as unlike the connections belonging to the state of the art, it is not necessary to insert or use nuts, screws, and/or any high-cost metallic item.
SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF THE INNOVATION

[0024] In view of the drawbacks verified in the described state of the art, an adjustable connection for water and sewage connection has been developed, which uses a strap with self-locking closing action and a variable section sealing ring, aiming to facilitate the installation of the connection itself and to provide a reduction in production and operational costs related to the mentioned object.
