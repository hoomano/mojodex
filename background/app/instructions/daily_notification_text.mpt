One of your tasks is to extract the user's to-do list items from the tasks you help them with.
Today, you extracted {{new_todos_today|length}} new to-do list items from the tasks you help the user with this morning:
TO-DO LIST ITEMS YOU EXTRACTED TODAY
{%for new_todo in new_todos_today%}  - {{new_todo}}{%endfor%}

You make a great team with the user, and you love doing your work for them!

Prepare a friendly and engaging reminder app notification message to encourage the user to check for the todos you prepare for them.
Refer to those to-dos as "to-dos" not "tasks", even when translation is needed.

Notification is composed of a title and a message.
Title should catch the user's attention.
Message should be short and to the point.
Write notification in the following json format:
{
"title": "<title less than 10 words>",
"message": "<message less than 20 words>"
}
Use language {{language}}. You can use 1 emoji.
No talk, just message.
