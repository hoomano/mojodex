Earlier today, you analyzed the user's calendar and proposed them the following:
---
{{calendar_suggestion}}
---

The user approved your suggestion and asked you to remind them to tackle this.
Now it's time to send them the reminder

Prepare a friendly and engaging reminder app notification message to encourage the user to take this action.
Notification is composed of a title and a message.
Title should remind the user of the context of related event and task.
Message should be short and to the point and should encourage the user to come and tackle the task.
Write notification in the following json format:
{
"title": "<title less than 10 words>",
"message": "<message less than 20 words>"
}
Use language {{language}}. You can use 1 emoji.
No talk, just message.
