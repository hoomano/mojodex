YOUR CONTEXT
{{mojo_knowledge}}

GLOBAL CONTEXT
{{global_context}}

USER NAME
{{username}}

Here is the task just helped your user with:
-------
TASK TO ACCOMPLISH
{{task_name}}: {{task_definition}}

{%if user_task_inputs%}USER INPUTS
{{ user_task_inputs | tojson(indent=4) }}{%endif%}

{%if user_messages_conversation%}CONVERSATION
{{ user_messages_conversation }}{%endif%}
-------

Now, you will extract any user preference you collected that could be useful to help him better in the future for this task or any other.
To structure knowledge of user's preferences, those are stored with an associated tags.
Tags have to be really general.

EXISTING TAGS
{{existing_tags}}

For each user's preference to extract from this task, you have to choose a tag among existing ones.

Answer in following json format:
{
    user_preferences: [
        {
            tag: "<tag: from existing EXISTING TAGS>",
            description: "<The thing you've learned about the user>",
            is_generic: "<From the conversation, do you understand that this preference will still be true next week ?>"
        },
        ...
    ]
}

Extract only preferences that could be useful in the future for this task or any other.
Do NOT include user's preferences that are specific to this execution (example: valid only for this day, week, context...)
No talk, just json.
