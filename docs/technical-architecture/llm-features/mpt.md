# Mojodex Prompt Template (MPT) File Format

## Introduction

This document introduces the Mojodex Prompt Template (`.mpt`) file format, a new standard designed to streamline and enhance the process of generating inputs for large language models (LLMs) within our development workflows. The `.mpt` format is a composition of jinja2 templating, HTML-like custom tagging for document formatting, and unstructured pseudo-code, enabling a flexible, powerful approach to crafting LLM prompts.

## Key Principles

1. Prompting is coding: jinja2 templating and pseudo-code for dynamic, complex prompts.
2. Divide and conquer: unified prompting library for easy multi-LLM architecture strategy.
3. Token poor: reduce the token size of the prompt to optimize the LLM input.

## Motivation

As our reliance on LLMs increases, the complexity and variety of prompts we need to generate have grown. Traditional methods of prompt creation often involve a cumbersome, error-prone process of manually editing and formatting text, lacking standardization and efficiency. The `.mpt` format aims to address these challenges by providing:

- **Standardization:** A unified file format allows for consistent prompt creation across different projects and teams.
- **Efficiency:** The use of jinja2 templating and custom tags streamlines the process of generating dynamic, complex prompts.
- **Flexibility:** Support for unstructured pseudo-code and custom tags ensures that developers can express a wide range of logic and formatting requirements.
- **Version Control:** A dash bang style header in each `.mpt` file specifies the LLM model version, author, and additional metadata, facilitating better management and compatibility of prompt templates over time.

## `.mpt` File Format Specification

### Header

The `.mpt` file begins with a dash bang style header that includes essential metadata:

``` bash
#! gpt4-turbo/2023-03-15-preview
#! gpt-4-turbo-preview
```

### Body

The body of the `.mpt` file contains a mix of jinja2 templates, custom HTML-like tags, and pseudo-code:


```html
<template>
    <title>
        Hello, {{ name }}! This is a sample template.   
    </title>    
    <content>
        <if not all informations required display a special message, otherwise do something>
    </custom_logic>
</template>
```

## MPT Workflow

Developers create `.mpt` files following the format specification. The runtime sequence involves:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Cleaning\nDashbang] --> B[Jinja2\nResolution]
    B --> C[Generate\nLLM Input]
    C --> D["(soon) Compression"]
```

1. **Cleaning Dashbang:** The header is cleaned from the processing input to the LLM.
2. **Jinja2 Resolution:** Templates are processed to substitute variables and expressions with actual values.
3. **Generate LLM Input:** The cleaned, resolved template serves as the input for the appropriate LLM.
4. **(soon) Compression:** Optimize the LLM input with compression algorithms to reduce the token size â€“ this is optional and depends on the LLM model & tokenizer.

## Example

!!! info "file translation.mpt"
    ```
    #! gpt4-turbo/2023-03-15-preview
#! gpt-4-turbo-preview
    #! mistral-large

    Translate this text to {{language}}:
    <text_start>
    {{text}}
    <text_end>
    If text is already in {{language}}, return it as is.
    No talk, just translation.
    Do not include tags in response.


    ```

!!! code Usage
    ```python
    >>> mpt = MPT('translation.mpt', text='hello', language='english')
    >>> print(mpt)
    MPT: translation.mpt
    
    >>> print(mpt.prompt)
    Translate this text to english:
    <text_start>
    hello
    <text_end>
    If text is already in english, return it as is.
    No talk, just translation.
    Do not include tags in response.
    
    
    
    >>> print(mpt.dashbangs)
    [{'model_name': 'gpt-4-turbo', 'version': '2023-03-15-preview'}, {'model_name': 'mistral-large', 'version': 'latest'}]
    
    >>> print(mpt.models)
    ['gpt-4-turbo', 'mistral-large']
    
    >>> print(mpt.tags) 
    ['<text_start>', '<text_end>']   
    ```

## Implementation Plan

The implementation involves developing a VSCode extension that supports the `.mpt` file format, including syntax highlighting, linting, and integration with LLM runtime processes.
