DESCRIPTION\n\nDistribution device for a formulation of at least two compounds chosen from a set of selectable compounds and associated container\n\nTechnical Field\n\nThe invention relates to a distribution device for a formulation of at least two compounds chosen from a set of selectable compounds.\n\nThe various containers incorporating these selectable compounds can be presented in the form of interchangeable containers allowing for the replenishment of the selectable compounds of the distribution device. Thus, the invention also relates to a container associated with the distribution device.\n\nThe invention can be implemented in a large number of fields where it is sought to obtain a formulation from different possible compounds.\n\nThe invention finds a particularly advantageous application in the field of cosmetics, where it is sought to be able to formulate a cream that is custom-tailored to the skin treatment needs of a user.\n\nState of the Art\n\nCosmetic products have evolved in recent years to specifically meet the skin treatment needs of a user. To do this, several solutions now propose to test the physiological characteristics of a user\'s skin to guide them towards the purchase of a suitable cream. Instead of recommending the purchase of a standard cream, the company IOMA® offers a solution called "IOMA In.Lab" allowing to test the physiological parameters of a user in a store to formulate a custom cream.\n\nHowever, the physiological parameters of a user\'s skin can vary over time, and it is sought to be able to formulate tailor-made treatments that evolve over time based on the demands experienced by the user\'s skin. To do this, the company IEVA® offers a jewelry piece "Twin.C" intended to be worn by the user to measure, over time, the parameters of the environment in which the user evolves. This jewelry "Twin.C" allows measuring outdoor or indoor pollution, sun exposure, ambient noise, brightness, temperature and humidity, and the number of steps. With all this information, it is possible to advise a health/well-being ritual adapted to each user and capable of evolving over time. Furthermore, it is possible to determine the formulation of a cream specifically adapted to a user\'s needs.\n\nThe realization of this cream can then be formulated in-store, for example with the "IOMA In.Lab" solution. To be more independent and reactive, this cream can also be made at home. To do this, several companies offer machines for formulating a custom cosmetic product, for example, the "HyLab" formulator from the company Romy® or the "Custom D.O.S.E" solution from the company L\'Oréal®, whose machine is described in patent WO 2017/95854.\n\nTo generate their custom cream, the user has a number of capsules containing the compounds of the different creams that they can formulate from the machine. During the manufacturing of the cream, the machine proceeds to extract the desired quantities of the compounds present in the various capsules inserted into the machine. The machine then mixes the extracted compounds to obtain a cream whose appearance corresponds to a standard cream but whose compounds and their quantities are determined to measure.\n\nThis type of solution is nevertheless very little portable because, like a coffee machine, this machine requires an electrical supply and a large number of electromechanical actuators to obtain the desired formulation, and in particular to proceed with the mixing of the compounds.\n\nFurthermore, the use of capsules to integrate the different compounds that can be used to obtain the formulation leads to storage constraints and pollution generated by the waste of used capsules.\n\nTechnical Problem of the Invention\n\nThe technical problem of the invention is to obtain a formulation of at least two compounds chosen from a set of selectable compounds in a much more portable way than existing solutions.\n\nDescription of the Invention\n\nTo solve this technical problem, the invention proposes a distribution device that allows extracting compounds stored in containers to transport them to a distribution surface. Thus, instead of completely making a cream with the necessary mixing step, the invention proposes to deliver a desired quantity of the formulation for each application.\n\nBy delivering the compounds on the distribution surface, the user can then collect the compounds with their finger to apply the formulation to their skin. The user\'s finger collecting the components thus performs the combination of the compounds.\n\nThe invention is therefore the result of a discovery that the active principles of a cream do not result from the mixing step classically performed but from the compounds taken independently. Thus, a simple combination of the compounds, performed with a user\'s finger, is sufficient to obtain the same effects on the skin.\n\nTo this end, according to a first aspect, the invention relates to a distribution device for a formulation of at least two compounds chosen from a set of selectable compounds, said device comprising:\n- a plurality of containers storing said different selectable compounds;\n- pumping means associated with each container;\n- a distribution surface comprising at least two outlet orifices intended to transport at least two chosen compounds;\n- selection means allowing to arrange said at least two outlet orifices in front of the pumping means of said chosen compounds so as to allow said pumping means of said chosen compounds to transport said chosen compounds to the distribution surface;\n- an actuator configured to only activate the pumping means of said chosen compounds and only deliver said at least two chosen compounds to said distribution surface.\n\nThe invention thus allows delivering, on a distribution surface, a specific formulation obtained from a set of selectable compounds. In doing so, the invention allows a user to make a dose of a cream adapted to their needs.\n\nUnlike existing custom formulation machines that aim to make a complete pot of cream, the invention proposes to distribute only one or more doses necessary for an application, so that the invention\'s device can be much more compact and portable than existing formulation machines.\n\nAccording to the invention, the pumping means can correspond to pumps actuated mechanically or electromechanically. In the case of electromechanical pumps, the distribution device preferably integrates batteries and a control board for the electromechanical actuators integrated into the distribution device to form an autonomous and compact distribution device.\n\nPreferably, the distribution device comprises mechanical pumps to form the pumping means to obtain a purely mechanical distribution device. In this embodiment, said actuator preferably corresponds to a push button whose upper face corresponds to said distribution surface, said pumping means having a stroke greater or equal to the stroke of the push button. Thus, the activation of the push button activates the pumps and allows delivering the selected compounds to the distribution surface.\n\nThe selection of the compounds can be performed by any mechanical or electromechanical means. Preferably, the selection means correspond to mechanical means that allow moving the orifices or the containers to modify the correspondence between the orifices and the containers.\n\nAccording to a first embodiment in which the orifices are fixed, at least one of said selection means corresponds to a barrel integrating several containers, a rotation of said barrel causing a modification of the correspondence between an orifice and one of the containers integrated into said barrel.\n\nThis embodiment allows mechanically selecting the chosen compounds to distribute the formulation. When the compounds are selected, the user can then simply activate the pumping means via the actuator to obtain the compounds of the formulation on the distribution surface.\n\nIt is possible to inhibit the operation of the actuator to avoid possible false manipulations of the distribution device. To do this, it is possible to use a protective cap which, once in place, blocks access to the actuator. According to this embodiment, said device comprises a removable protective cap configured to cover said distribution surface and inhibit the activation of said actuator.\n\nRegarding the compounds used by the distribution device, they can vary depending on the applications of the distribution device. Preferably, said device comprises two distinct types of compounds stored in two distinct types of containers; said at least two compounds being chosen to obtain a formulation of at least a first type of compounds and at least a second type of compounds.\n\nFor example, said device comprises between one and three compounds of the first type and between six and eight compounds of the second type to allow obtaining a large number of possible formulations.\n\nDepending on the applications, compounds of distinct natures can be used. For example, the invention can be implemented for the formulation of a cosmetic cream. In this embodiment, said first type of compounds may correspond to bases, for example aqueous or oily bases, and said second type of compounds may correspond to serums.\n\nFor a cosmetic cream, a formulation typically comprises a base and a serum with a larger quantity of base than serum. To obtain this volume difference with the distribution device, the first containers have a larger volume than the second containers and said pumping means associated with said first containers have a larger pumping volume than said pumping means associated with said second containers for the same activation of said actuator.\n\nPreferably, said plurality of containers is integrated into at least one support presenting at least two removable parts to allow the replacement or filling of at least one container. By replacing the containers according to their needs, a user can increase the number of possible formulations that they can make with said distribution device of the invention by using containers with other compounds than those present in the distribution device.\n\nFurthermore, replacing the containers also increases the lifespan of the distribution device by replacing or refilling the empty containers. The possibility of being able to fill the emptied containers also limits the waste generated by the distribution device of the invention, thus improving its ecological footprint.\n\nBrief Description of the Figures\n\nThe way of implementing the invention as well as the advantages that result from it will be clear from the following embodiments, given as an indication but not limited, with the support of the annexed figures in which figures 1 to 16 represent:\n\nFigure 1 is a front view of a distribution device for a formulation according to a first embodiment of the invention which is not included in the object of the claims.\nFigure 2 is an exploded perspective view of the distribution device of figure 1; Figure 3 is a sectional view of the distribution device of figure 1;\nFigure 4 is a top view of a lower ring of the distribution device of figure 1;\nFigure 5 is a perspective view of the lower ring of figure 4;\nFigure 6 is a perspective view of an upper ring of the distribution device of figure 1;\nFigure 7 is a partial sectional view of the distribution device of figure 1;\nFigure 8 is a perspective view of a container adapted to the distribution device of figure 1;\nFigure 9 is a front view of a distribution device for a formulation according to a second embodiment of the invention;\nFigure 10 is an exploded perspective view of the distribution device of figure 9;\nFigure 11 is a sectional view of the distribution device of figure 9;\nFigure 12 is a perspective view of a lower barrel of the distribution device of figure 9;\nFigure 13 is a perspective view of an upper barrel of the distribution device of figure 9;\nFigure 14 is a top view of the upper barrel of figure 13;\nFigure 15 is a perspective view from below of the distribution surface of the distribution device of figure 9; and\nFigure 16 is a perspective view from above of the distribution surface of the distribution device of figure 9.\n\nDetailed Description of the Invention\n\nIn the following description, two distinct embodiments illustrate an entirely mechanical distribution device. Alternatively, the invention can be implemented with electromechanical components.\n\nFigures 1 to 3 illustrate a distribution device 10a according to a first embodiment of the invention which is not included in the object of the claims.\n\nIn this embodiment, the distribution device 10a has a substantially cylindrical shape with a height between 7 and 15 cm and a diameter between 3 and 10 cm.\n\nThus, the distribution device 10a is presented in the form of a portable bottle.\n\nThis distribution device 10a has an external shell formed by several superimposed parts 11a-11e and fixed together. The three lower parts 11a to 11c have complementary truncated cylindrical shapes allowing to obtain a cylinder integrating the different selectable compounds. The assembly of these three lower parts 11a to 11c allows varying the materials, textures, or colors of this cylinder. Above this cylinder, the shell has a shoulder 11d surmounted by a cylindrical rim 11e. In addition, these different parts 11a-11e of the shell are mounted removably so as to open the shell and replace or refill one of the containers 14a, 15. The shoulder 11d and the rim 11e allow integrating the pumping means 16-17 and the selection means 18-19.\n\nFurthermore, the rim 11e is configured to support a protective cap 12 allowing to close the distribution device 10a. For example, the protective cap 12 can be mounted by clipping or screwing onto the rim 11e.\n\nInside the distribution device 10a, the different selectable compounds are integrated into containers 14a-15. The selectable compounds can be distributed in large volume containers 14a integrating base compounds and small volume containers 15 integrating serums to formulate a cosmetic cream. For example, the containers 14a have a volume between 20 and 35 ml while the containers 15 have a volume between 3 and 8 ml.\n\nOf course, other types of compounds can be used to obtain other formulations without changing the invention.\n\nThe extraction of the compounds stored in these containers 14a-15 is preferably carried out by a manual pump 16 or 17 associated with each container 14a-15.\n\nA manual pump can aspirate the compounds through a supply tube extending to the bottom of the container. Preferably, a piston is integrated into each container 14a-15 so that a pressure exerted on its pump 16-17 causes a depression that tends to move the piston towards the top of the container to extract the compound through an opening provided at the top of the pump 16-17.\n\nTo obtain the desired formulation, the distribution device 10a allows transporting the chosen compounds to a distribution surface 20a so that a user can collect it with their finger. To form the selection means, the embodiment of figures 1 to 8 proposes to use two concentric rings 18-19 forming at the same time the distribution surface 20a, the selection means of the chosen compounds, and an actuator for the pumps 16-17. The ring 19 being mounted on the ring 18, the ring 18 is called "lower ring" while the ring 19 is called "upper ring" in the rest of the description.\n\nAs illustrated in figures 4 and 5, the lower ring 18 has a central cylinder 35 whose lower face is provided with a guide pin 36. For example, the central cylinder 35 can have a thickness between 0.8 and 5mm and a diameter between 2 and 8 cm. The lower face of the lower ring 18 extends in the form of a disc 37 whose diameter is greater than that of the central cylinder 35. For example, the disc 37 can have a thickness between 0.4 and 2mm and a diameter between 3 and 10 cm. The terminal part of this disc 37 has a rim 38 extending orthoradially towards the upper face 40 of the central cylinder 35. The height of this rim 38 can be between 0.2 and 2 mm.\n\nThe central cylinder 35 has a cylindrical orifice 21 opening onto both the upper 40 and lower faces and made close to the edges of the central cylinder 35. This cylindrical orifice 21 can have a diameter between 0.4 and 2 mm. In addition, six other orifices 22a are regularly distributed in the disc 37. These other cylindrical orifices 22a can also have a diameter between 0.4 and 2 mm.\n\nAs illustrated in figure 6, the upper ring 19 is in the form of a ring 19. This ring 19 can have an internal diameter between 2 and 8 cm and an external diameter between 3 and 10 cm. The thickness of this ring 19 is preferably between 0.4 and 2 mm. A cylindrical orifice 22b is provided in the thickness of this ring 19. This orifice 22b can have a diameter between 0.4 and 2 mm.\n\nAs illustrated in figure 7, the distribution surface 20a is obtained by the two upper surfaces 40-41 of the two rings 18-19. These two upper surfaces 40-41 are substantially coplanar when the upper ring 19 is mounted around the lower ring 18. Thus, the center of the distribution surface 20a is formed by the upper face 40 of the lower ring 18 passing through the upper ring 19 while the perimeter of this distribution surface 20a is formed by the upper face 41 of the lower ring 18.\n\nTo select the compounds and transport them to the distribution surface 20a, the two rings 18-19 are movable in rotation around a central axis Al. Preferably, these rings 18-19 can only be driven in rotation when the protective cap 12 is removed from the distribution device 10a.\n\nThe lower ring 18 is mounted directly above the set of pumps 16-17 and its outlet orifice 21 allows transporting a compound present in a container 14a to its upper face 40, that is to say, to the distribution surface 20a. The transport of a compound present in a container 15 is carried out by crossing the orifices 22a of the lower ring 18 and the orifice 22b of the upper ring 19.\n\nThe activation of the pumps 16-17 is obtained by moving the two rings 18-19. To do this, the two rings 18-19 are placed on the set of pumps 16-17 and the pin 36 ensures the guidance of the movement of the two rings 18-19.\n\nIn addition, the upper ring 19 is bent on the lower ring 18 at the level of the rim 38 so that the two rings 18-19 are movable together along the axis Al. The movement of the two rings 18-19 is consecutive to a user\'s pressure on the distribution surface 20a. This pressure has the effect of compressing all the pumps 16-17 and leading to the distribution of the formulation of the selected compounds. Indeed, during the activation of the pumps 16-17, only the pumps arranged in front of the orifices 21 and 22b see their compounds transported to the distribution surface 20a. After activation, that is to say, after the user\'s pressure, the two rings 18-19 are repositioned to their initial positions by the decompression of the springs of the pumps 16-17.\n\nTo facilitate the selection of the different compounds and avoid that one of the orifices 21 and 22b is positioned between two pumps 16-17, position detents are preferably implemented. For example, figure 7 illustrates a pin 50 and a spring integrated into a bore of the lower ring 18 and configured to cooperate with bores present at each possible position of the upper ring 19. Thus, the user can feel a difference in the rotation effort of the upper ring 19 between the possible positions and the intermediate positions of the ring 19.\n\nThis embodiment, illustrated in figures 1 to 7, which is not included in the object of the claims, can be implemented regardless of the shape of the containers. For example, the invention can be implemented with standard containers having a cylindrical shape.\n\nPreferably, to optimize the space inside the shell 11a-11e, the large volume container 14a has a specific shape allowing both to contain a compound and to integrate housings 30 to position cylindrical containers 15 of smaller volume.\n\nAs illustrated in figure 8, the container 14a has a hollow body 25 having substantially the shape of
