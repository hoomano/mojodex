ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE 

A hair styling comb for building a base for a hair 

styling having a plurality of teeth lying in a common 

plane and spaced from each other with ridge portions ex 

tending from the base of the teeth on both sides thereof 

in coplanar relation with the teeth, the ridge portions of 

one ridge in each space between the teeth having trans 

verse grooves for engaging the hair and pushing the hair 

toward the scalp as a person combs the hair in the di 

rection of the scalp. 

This invention relates to combs and is more particular 

ly directed to a hair styling comb. 

The present invention is an improvement over my dual 

purpose hair comb as rescribed and claimed in my co 

pending application filed  on Sept.  25,  1964, Ser.  No. 

399,289, entitled Dual Purpose Hair Comb which issued 

as Patent No. 3,324,865 on June 13, 1967. 

In order to style a person's hair effectively, the hair 

dresser must build up a firm base of hair close to the 

scalp and then shape the hair as desired upon the base 

so provided. When a firm base for the hair has been 

formed, it maintains the coiffure in the manner it has been 

styled for long periods of time and readily permits a per 

son to simply comb out or brush her hair back to its 

original style or shape thereby reducing to a minimum the 

money spent for hair styling. At present the services of an 

expert hair dresser or stylist are required for styling hair 

effectively as the combs now in use require a high degree 

of dexterity to build a proper and effective base for the 

stylish hairdos being demanded by women today. 

It is  contemplated that the present invention avoids 

the difficulty of building a firm base close to one's scalp, 

which is required in order to style the person's hair prop 

erly and effectively, and also permits one of lesser skill 

than the expert stylists to so do. 

Therefore, a principal object of the present invention is 

to provide a hair styling comb which permits the building 

up of a firm base of hair close to a person's Scalp readily 

50 

and most effectively. 

Another object of the present invention is to provide a 

hair styling comb with ridges between the teeth thereof, 

which permits the usual combing of the hair when strok 

ing away from the scalp while gripping and returning 

some strands of hair to build a base for a coiffure as the 

comb is returned toward the Scalp. 

A still further object of the present invention is to pro 

vide a hear styling comb having a dual purpose as de 

scribed hereinabove which is inexpensive in cost, simple 

in design and most effective to produce the desired coif 

55

With these and other object in view, the invention will 

be best understood from a consideration of the following 

detailed description taken in connection with the accom 

panying drawing forming a part of this specification, with 

the  understanding,  however,  that the  invention  is  not 

confined to any strict conformity with the showing of the 

drawing but may be changed or modified so long as such 

changes or modifications mark no material departure from 

the salient features of the invention as expressed in the

In the drawing:

vational view. 

FIGURE 1 is a perspective view of a comb embodying 

FIGURE 2 is a fragmentary and enlarged front ele 

FIGURES 3 and 4 are cross sectional  views taken 

along the lines 3-3 and 4-4, respectively, of FIGURE 2. 

Referring to  the drawing wherein like  numerals are 

used  to  designate similar parts throughout the several 

views, the numeral 10 refers to a hair styling comb con 

structed in accordance with my invention and consisting 

of two parts A and B joined together by a handle portion 

11. The part or portion A is the combing and hair base 

building part while the part B is used to style the hair 

as described in detail in my copending application. 

The comb portion A consists of an elongated back 12 

with an end tooth 13 extending at right angle to the elon 

gated back 12 but lying in the same plane as the latter. 

At the other end of the elongated back 12 which joins the 

handle 11 there is a similar end tooth 14 which with the 

end tooth 13 affords rigidity to the comb portion A. As 

exists in all combs, there is a plurality of teeth 15 posi 

tioned in coplanar relation with the end teeth 13 and 14 

and equally spaced from each other extending from the 

elongated back member 12. The teeth 15 are tapered 

along their front and rear edges to a rounded free end 

portion as best shown by FIGURES 3 and 4. On either 

side of each of the teeth 15 and in close proximity to the 

base member 12 are ridges or projections 16 and 17 of 

equal length and which extend about one-third the length 

of the teeth 15. The ridge or projection 16 is  smooth 

along its full length while the ridge or projection 17 is 

provided with a plurality of transversely disposed Serra 

tions or grooves 18. The projections 16 and 17 are so 

disposed that the projection 16 is opposed to the projec 

tion 17 in each space formed by the teeth 15 so that as 

the hair is combed in the building of a base for a coiffure, 

the  projections  16 and 17 coact to form the base as 

explained in detail hereinafter. 

The handle 11 is slightly tapered in thickness in the 

direction of the hair styling portion B which consists of 

a base member 20 from which extend a plurality of 

prongs 21. The prongs 21 are coplanar with the remainder 

of my comb 10 but extend in a direction 90 degrees re 

moved from that of the teeth 15. The prongs 21 are like 

wise tapered to a rounded point and are fewer in number 

than the teeth 15 and spaced apart a greater distance. 

In the normal use of my comb 10, the user grasps the 

comb at the handle 11 and uses it at first as a normal 

comb to comb out the hair. When the operator decides to 

commence building up the base of the hair for a desired 

coiffure, he grasps the end of a strand of hair with one 

hand. Then he inserts the teeth 15 deeply into the hair 

that he is gripping in his hand, but at a position close to 

the scalp and combs the hair in the direction of the scalp. 

When the comb 10 arrives at the scalp he removes the 

comb and again inserts the teeth 15 of the comb 10 in 

the hair. This time he places the comb 10 into the strand 

of hair being held by his hand at a greater distance from 

the scalp  than heretofor and again sinks the teeth 15 

deeply in the hair as he combs the hair in the direction of 

the person's scalp.  He repeats this  operation until  the 

strand of hair that is being held by one hand has been 

combed in the direction of the scalp from the furthest 

end possible which is at the position of his hand grasping 

the hair. At this time a base has been built close to the 

scalp which base is firm and rigid. This base consists of 

individual strands of hair that were pushed back by the 

comb toward the scalp, building upon other hair that had 

been previously pushed back. As the teeth 15 are made to 

sink deeply in the hair, the hair is received between the 

projections 16 and 17 and becomes wedged therebetween; 

3,444,866

and when the comb 10 is pushed toward the scalp, the 

short hair not within the grasp of the person that is hold 

ing the hair as well as that hair held least loosely by his 

grasp will become engaged by the serrations 18 and will 

slide with the comb 10 toward the scalp. The remaining 

hair in the person's grasp will  remain immobile. The 

buildup of the base commences at the scalp and layer 

upon layer of base is built thereupon until a proper base 

for the desired coiffure has been effected. 

After the base has been produced, the operator uses 

the prongs 21 to shape the hair into the desired coiffure. 

The prongs 21 are used to lift and stroke the hair into 

the desired style which is readily maintained by the firm 

base that supports it. After a period of time the coiffure 

will begin to lose its shape, but the base will remain firm 

so that all that need be done to restore the coiffure is to 

use the prongs 21 as when the coiffure was originally

effected. 

It  is  preferable  that  my comb be  made of plastic 

material though any appropriate materials may be used 

having some flexibility and made by the injection mold 

method as a unit. 

Having described my invention, what I claim as new 

and desire to secure by Letters Patent is: 

1. A hair styling comb for building a base for hair 

styling comprising 

an elongated back portion, 

a plurality of substantially equally spaced teeth extend 

ing from said  back portion  and having free  end 

portions, 

said teeth lying substantially in a plane and forming a 

plurality of equal spaces therebetween, each of said 

m 

30 

4. 

teeth  having ridge portions  formed thereon,  said 

ridge portions  lying in said spaces and extending 

from said back portion and terminating in spaced 

relation to said free end portions, 

the ridge portion of one tooth having transverse grooves 

facing the ridge portion on the adjacent tooth, said 

latter  ridge  portion  being smooth throughout its 

whereby upon the combing of the hair in a direction of 

one's scalp, said  strands of hair are pushed back 

toward the scalp to form a base for the desired hair 

length, 

styling. 

2. The structure as recited by claim 1 taken in com 

bination with a handle means mounted at one end of said 

back portion and in coplanar relation thereto and a plur 

ality of spaced hair styling prongs extending transversly of 

said handle means and lying substantially in the same plane 

as said comb and said handle, said styling prongs being 

substantially longer than said teeth and spaced further 

20 apart than said teeth.
